Hi
9:17 PM 
I have received few changes that needs from two owners.. 
9:17 PM
I still need to receive comments from another two owners of the document.. 
I will collate all the comments and send them to you.. 
9:18 PM
Also I think you missed uploading the word document in the link.. 
So we are using the pdf document to mark the changes that have to be made.. 
9:19 PM 
OK, that's fine, I guess. Didn't realize the Word doc didn't get uploaded. Do you prefer using the Word doc?
9:20 PM 
We are using the pdf document.. 
Not necessary
Thank you..

ok, thanks!
