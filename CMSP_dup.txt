**Change Fields**

1. High-level Technical Description of the Change Request:
System Name:  
New link addition at *** location*** as a part of network dual link resilience project.

2. What is the desired outcome for this request?
The network will be redundant and resilient.

****Implementation Task Rules*****

1. If ANY tasks are needed to be completed by any other group other than the implementing Cisco Team or Cisco FE/Vendor then that task needs to be noted in the following format:

No additional tasks required.

These tasks should be placed in between the correct plans/section below.

2. A Summary of all tasks will be provided in this section (replacing the Example below) so that a clear understanding of all teams involved and when their assigend tasks will be completed.
